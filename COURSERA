Please calculate the Process Cycle Efficiency for this Value Stream? Please show your calculations.

Process Cycle Efficiency= valued process time / cycle time
</br>
Valued Added time= 10 +1 +1 +60 + 1 +30 +240 +30 +60 +30 +60 + 30 +4320 +1440 +10 =6323 min
</br>
Non valued Added time = 720 + 720 +720 + 720 + 4320 +1440 +2880 +1440 +4320 + 7200 +7200 +720 = 32400 min
</br>
Cycle time= 6323 + 32400 =38723 min
</br>
So, Process Cycle Efficiency= 6323 / 38723 = 0.163 =16.3%

Make a recommendation for improving this process. Please specify what impact it will have in terms of VSM step and process cycle efficiency. Please calcuate new Process cycle efficiency if recommendations are implemented (HINT: For recommendations, think about merging steps, removing un-necessary steps or recommending alternatives to improve some of the process)?
